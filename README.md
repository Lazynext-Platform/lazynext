> Most AI video tools generate a clip. Lazynext gives you the ad workflow around it: product input, script, shots, reference assets, video generation, credits, login, and deployment.

## What this project is

Lazynext is a self-hostable AI ad generator for e-commerce teams, agencies, and builders, powered by [Atlas Cloud](https://www.atlascloud.ai?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=atlas-marketing-studio). It turns product photos, presenter images, product links, prompts, or reference ads into ready-to-use video ad concepts.

It is a real, runnable e-commerce creative studio with opinionated workflows for:

- AI UGC ads and product review videos
- Reference-ad remakes with your own product and presenter
- Short drama ads for social commerce
- Two-person ad skits from a simple product idea
- Multi-model image, video, LLM, TTS, and lip-sync pipelines
- Credit metering, Google login, Stripe top-ups, and Cloudflare deployment

## AI ad workflows

Each workflow is a complete AI ad generation path, not just a single model call.

| Workflow | What it does | Use it for | Models |
|---|---|---|---|
| **UGC Product Ad** | Product + presenter photos -> lip-synced UGC ad | An **AI UGC ad generator** or **product-to-video ad generator** for product reviews, creator testimonials, direct-response e-commerce ads, and social ad variations. | Atlas Cloud prompt expansion, `nano-banana/edit` first frame, `seedance-2.0` image-to-video |
| **Reference to Ad** | Upload a viral ad -> remake it with your product and presenter | A **reference ad remake AI workflow** for adapting proven ad structure, talent framing, and product placement to your own offer. | `gemini-omni-flash/video-edit`, optional ElevenLabs TTS, optional `veed/lipsync`, fallback to `kling motion-control` |
| **AI Drama Ad** | One topic -> comedy script -> shot-by-shot drama ad | An **AI short drama ad generator** for social commerce, story-led e-commerce ads, and short-form video campaigns. | Atlas Cloud LLM script generation, reference image generation, `seedance-2.0/reference-to-video` per shot |
| **Ad Skit** | One-line product -> two-person comedy skit | A **short ad skit generator** for creator ads, TikTok-style product jokes, hook testing, and fast creative iteration. | Atlas Cloud LLM script generation, `gpt-image-2` product shot, `seedance-2.0/reference-to-video` with audio |

All workflows auto-detect the input language. Write the product brief in English, Chinese, or another language, and the generated script/ad follows that language.

## Who it is for

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AtlasCloudAI/atlas-marketing-studio.git
cd atlas-marketing-studio
npm install
```

For a Vercel-compatible local Next.js runtime:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill Neon, Public Vercel Blob, auth, and Atlas Cloud values.
npm run dev:vercel
```

For Cloudflare/OpenNext preview:

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
# D1 and R2 come from wrangler.jsonc bindings.
npm run cf:preview
```

Core application variables:

```env
ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
PAYMENT_PROVIDER=atlas
```

Platform resources:

| Platform | Database | Media storage |
|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare | D1 binding `DB` | R2 binding `MEDIA_BUCKET` |
| Vercel | `DATABASE_URL` for Neon Postgres | Public Blob via `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` |

Where to get each value:

| Variable | Where to get it | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY` | [Atlas Cloud API Keys](https://www.atlascloud.ai/docs/api-keys) | Create an Atlas Cloud API key for image, video, LLM, TTS, and lip-sync generation. API keys are shown once, so store it safely. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | [Neon connection string](https://neon.com/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app) | Vercel only. Use the pooled Neon Postgres connection string. |
| `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | Vercel project Storage | Vercel only. Connect a **Public** Blob store; Vercel injects the token. |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | [NextAuth secret](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#nextauth_secret) | Generate locally with `openssl rand -base64 32`. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | [Google Cloud OAuth clients](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients) | Create a Web application OAuth client for Google sign-in. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | [Google Cloud OAuth clients](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients) | Copy the client secret from the same Web application OAuth client. |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | [Stripe API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) | Optional. Required only when `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=stripe`. Use test keys for local development. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | [Stripe Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) | Optional. Required for Stripe webhook verification in production. |

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deploy

The same business code targets two infrastructure stacks. `VERCEL=1`
automatically selects Neon/Blob during Vercel builds; `cf:*` scripts explicitly
select D1/R2.

### Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAtlasCloudAI%2Fatlas-marketing-studio&env=ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY,DATABASE_URL,BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN,NEXTAUTH_SECRET,NEXTAUTH_URL,GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,PAYMENT_PROVIDER&envDescription=Atlas%20Cloud%20key%2C%20Neon%20database%2C%20Public%20Vercel%20Blob%2C%20NextAuth%2C%20Google%20OAuth%2C%20and%20payment%20provider&project-name=lazynext&repository-name=lazynext)

Create/connect a Neon database and a **Public** Vercel Blob store, initialize
the Neon schema with `npm run db:push:vercel`, then deploy with the standard
`npm run build` command.

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

```bash
npm run cf:deploy
```

Cloudflare uses the `DB` D1 binding and `MEDIA_BUCKET` R2 binding in
`wrangler.jsonc`; it does not use `DATABASE_URL` or `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`.
Set application secrets with Wrangler or the dashboard:

```bash
wrangler secret put ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY
wrangler secret put NEXTAUTH_SECRET
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for resource creation, database
initialization, legacy R2 compatibility, verification commands, and data
migration boundaries.

## Credits and pricing

Users spend in-app credits while your deployment pays Atlas Cloud in USD. The app maps AI generation cost to credits:

- Fixed-cost steps such as image generation, LLM scripts, and TTS use flat credit prices.
- Video generation uses dynamic pricing based on model, duration, and resolution.

`src/lib/video-pricing.ts` calculates video credits like this:

```text
credits = ceil(perSecond[resolution] * seconds * ACCOUNT_MARKUP * MARGIN / CREDIT_USD)
```

Top-up packs live in `src/config/pricing.ts`, so you can adjust margin and packaging in one place.

## License

Lazynext is a Lazynext-branded distribution built on the open-source [Atlas Marketing Studio](https://github.com/AtlasCloudAI/atlas-marketing-studio) project (MIT). All AI generation runs through the Atlas Cloud API.
