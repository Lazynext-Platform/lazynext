/**
 * Per-request context (BYOK — bring your own Atlas key).
 *
 * A user can paste their own AtlasCloud API key in the browser; the frontend
 * sends it on every generation request as the `x-atlas-key` header. When present:
 *   - every Atlas call in that request uses the user's key (see atlas.ts apiKey())
 *   - credits are NOT deducted (the user pays AtlasCloud directly — see credits.ts)
 *
 * We never persist the key server-side; it lives only in the browser's
 * localStorage and in the per-request AsyncLocalStorage store below.
 *
 * node:async_hooks only exists server-side (workerd via the nodejs_compat flag).
 * Client component graphs can transitively import this module (page → atlas.ts →
 * here), so the store is created LAZILY and node:async_hooks is aliased away in
 * the client bundle (see next.config.mjs). The client never calls these
 * functions, so the store is never constructed in the browser.

// (see next.config.mjs). workerd (nodejs_compat) resolves it fine at runtime.
